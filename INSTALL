Building from source
--------------------

requirements:

- c++ compiler
- cmake >= 2.8.12
- zlib libraries and headers
- ncurses libraries and headers

$ tar zxvf leanux-x.x.x.tar.gz
$ cd leanux-x.x.x
$ mkdir release
$ cd release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make

this produces a shared library and a few tools requiring it.

$ make test
runs some basic tests.

$ make doc
generates html documentation, but requires doxygen and dot tool.

$ make package
creates installable package for the build platform.

Installation
------------

Allthough a 'make install' is provided (and likely to require superuser
privileges), you should do a 'make package' and install the .rpm or .deb,
which takes care of the actual binary, library and manual page install,
conforming to target paltform standards.

For common GNU/Linux distributions, one may find packages ready for install
at http://www.o-rho.com/leanux.

For gentoo, an ebuild is produced by cmake, or it can be downloaded at
http://www.o-rho.com/leanux. As leanux in not in the
portage tree (yet:), use the instructions at
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Overlay/Local_overlay
to emerge the leanux-x.x.x.ebuild.

For Arch, a PKGBUILD is produced by cmake, but you must run cmake again 
-after- make package_source for the sha512sum to be set correctly in the 
PKGBUILD - or do it yourself by hand.

leanux is tested against and packaging-aware of:

- gentoo (rules)
- arch
- opensuse 13
- centos 7
- debian 8
- fedora 22
- ubuntu 14,15
- redhat enterprise linux 6, 7
- suse linux enterprise server 11.2, 11.3
