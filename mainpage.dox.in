 * @LEANUX_SHORT_DESC@.
 *
 * leanux only reports on performance and configuration data, it provides no functionality that could change the system configuration.
 *
 * Most functionality can be invoked without root privileges, but the are @link root_access a few exceptions @endlink.
 *
 * This document is the C++ API documentation. Refer to @LEANUX_WEBSITE@ for information such as build instructions, tool
 description and precompiled package downloads.
 *
 * @section using_section Using leanux
 *
 * The first call to leanux must be leanux::init(), failing to do so will cause erroneous results.
 *
 * Refer to the <a class="el" href="examples.html">examples</a> for demonstrations on how to use the code, or check the source code fro the leanux::tools.
 *
 * @section system_section Namespaces
 *
 * The ::leanux namespace contains several subnamespaces
 *
 * | namespace | contains |
 * |---|---|
 * | leanux::block | access to block device configuration and performance data |
 * | leanux::cpu   | accress to cpu configuration and performance data |
 * | leanux::net   | accress to network configuration and performance data |
 * | leanux::pci   | accress to pci configuration and performance data |
 * | leanux::persist | library around SQLite3, which is used as storage backend by lard |
 * | leanux::process | accress to process operation and performance data |
 * | leanux::sysdevice | access to device (/sys/devices) configuration and performance data |
 * | leanux::system | access to system configuration and operation data |
 * | leanux::tools | contains several tools that use the leanux library |
 * | leanux::usb | access to usb configuration and operation data |
 * | leanux::util | utility clases and functions |
 * | leanux::vmem | access to (virtual) memory configuration and operation data |
