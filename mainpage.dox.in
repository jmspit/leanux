 * @LEANUX_SHORT_DESC@.
 *
 * leanux only reports, it provides no functionality that would change the system configuration.
 *
 * Most functionality can be invoked without root privileges, but the few exceptions are @link root_access listed here @endlink.
 *
 * This document is the C++ API documentation. Refer to @LEANUX_WEBSITE@ for more information, like build instructions, tool
 description and precompiled packages.
 *
 * @section using_section Using leanux
 *
 * The first function invoked from leanux <strong>must</strong> be leanux::init().
 *
 * @section system_section System namespace
 *
 * The leanux::system namespace provides basic system and kernel configuration,
 * such as leanux::system::getChassisType, leanux::system::getKernelVersion and so on.
 *
 * @section cpu_section CPU namespace
 * The leanux::cpu namespace contains CPU related functions and datastructures.
 *
 * - CPU topology, the number of physcial CPUs, CPU cores and logical CPUs (leanux::cpu::CPUTopology).
 * - CPU model, operating frequency, bogomips (leanux::cpu::CPUInfo).
 * - CPU usage statistics (leanux::cpu::getCPUStats).
 * - number of running and blocked processes, total number of context switches and forks (leanux::cpu::getSchedInfo).
 *
 * @section block_section Block namespace
 *
 * The leanux::block namespace provides configuration and performance data on various types of block devices and filesystems.
 *
 * @section net_section Net namespace
 * The leanux::net namespace retrieves network configuration and statistics.
 * @section process_section Process namespace
 *
 * The leanux::process namespace provides information on processes,
 *
 * - get statistics on a process with leanux::process::getProcPidStat
 * - get statistics on all processes with leanux::process::getAllProcPidStat
 *
 * @section build_section Building from source
 *
 * Follow the build instructions at @LEANUX_WEBSITE@.
 *
 * @section more_info_section More info
 * See @LEANUX_WEBSITE@ for more information or @LEANUX_BUG_URL@ to report bugs.
